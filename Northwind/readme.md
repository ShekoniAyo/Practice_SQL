# Overview
For this project, I used a Northwind DB generated from a .sql script on LearnIt Training Channel on Youtube.
You can see the script in `Northwindsql.sql`

-- I joined various tables from this DB to create my own table to use for my practice.
    The script is in `My first script.sql`

## My Practice
On this table, i would be exploring the 
- WHERE
- DISTINCT 
- COUNT
- GROUP BY
- ORDER BY 
- some aggregate functions and others
